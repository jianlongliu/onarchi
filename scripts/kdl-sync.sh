# The seven niri configs are authored on the machine (~/.config/niri/*.kdl, home directory as a real
# path) and collected in niri-config/local/ with the home directory replaced by /home/<user>, because
# niri does not expand $HOME. That substitution is the ONLY difference for six of the seven, so this
# transforms the machine copies the same way and compares byte for byte.
#
# layout.kdl is the exception: omarchy-niri-apply-theme rewrites its focus-ring / border colours from
# the current theme (and toggles border's bare `on`/`off` to match), so those lines legitimately change
# on every theme *or* wallpaper switch -- matugen re-derives the palette and the hook re-applies it.
# They are dropped from both sides before the compare; everything else in layout.kdl is still compared
# byte for byte, so a hand edit anywhere outside that block still fails the check.
#
# Skipped on a machine without ~/.config/niri (a fresh checkout). Override the machine directory with
# NIRI_CONFIG_DIR=/path and the placeholder with PLACEHOLDER=/home/you.
