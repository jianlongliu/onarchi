# Split Greeter and Split Lock — third-party code

The login screen in `split-greeter/` is called **Split Greeter**: it is a greetd
greeter (a Quickshell front end) built around the **Split** design from
`io.github.sirjul1337.lock-explorer` by SirJul1337 — hence the name. The design
is used under the MIT license below, with attribution; it is not our work.

`split-lock/` is the same design used as the session lock instead of a login
screen, and vendors the same files. Its `Service.qml` is a verbatim copy of
Omarchy's built-in `omarchy.lock` service (covered by [LICENSE](LICENSE)); it
ships unchanged because the lock service instantiates `LockView { }` by filename
out of its own directory — which is exactly what makes `LockView.qml` here the
entire adapter. `reference/` holds read-only copies of the upstream service and
view for comparison, under the same terms.


This repository is a port of [Omarchy](https://github.com/basecamp/omarchy) for
niri. Omarchy's MIT license and copyright (David Heinemeier Hansson) are in
[LICENSE](LICENSE) and cover everything not listed below.

`split-greeter/designs/`, `split-greeter/Commons/`, `split-greeter/Ui/` and the
design files in `split-lock/` (`Split.qml`, `DesignBase.qml`, `LockInput.qml`,
`PasswordField.qml`, `Avatar.qml`, `Wallpaper.qml`) are vendored from the
`io.github.sirjul1337.lock-explorer` plugin, which both reuse (the Split design).

That plugin's own `Service.qml` is based on Omarchy's built-in `omarchy.lock`
plugin, which is covered by [LICENSE](LICENSE).

The Split Greeter's own code (`shell.qml`, `Greetd.qml`, `UserPicker.qml`, `Users.qml`,
`SelfTest.qml`, `StateTest.qml`, `bridge/`, `tests/`, `install.sh`, `sync.sh`,
`niri.kdl`) was written for this port and is covered by [LICENSE](LICENSE).

So was the Split Lock's (`LockView.qml`, `manifest.json`, `install.sh`,
`vendor.py`, `tests/`).

## Fathom — MIT, Copyright (c) 2026 Maarten Tolhuijs

`shell/plugins/fathom/` is an experimental Alt-Tab switcher derived from
[Fathom](https://github.com/mtolhuys/fathom), a Hyprland/Omarchy plugin. Its
depth layout and depth-from-age maths (`Layout.js`, `Depth.js`) are adapted
from that project; the rest of the field was rewritten for niri, which differs
in what it can report and in when it delivers key events. Its license, verbatim:
